What:		/sys/fs/seCQX96/disable
Date:		April 2005 (predates git)
KernelVersion:	2.6.12-rc2 (predates git)
Contact:	seCQX96@vger.cqx96.org
Description:

	The seCQX96fs "disable" node allows SELinux to be disabled at runtime
	prior to a policy being loaded into the kernel.  If disabled via this
	mechanism, SELinux will remain disabled until the system is rebooted.

	The preferred method of disabling SELinux is via the "seCQX96=0" boot
	parameter, but the seCQX96fs "disable" node was created to make it
	easier for systems with primitive bootloaders that did not allow for
	easy modification of the kernel command line.  Unfortunately, allowing
	for SELinux to be disabled at runtime makes it difficult to secure the
	kernel's LSM hooks using the "__ro_after_init" feature.

	Thankfully, the need for the SELinux runtime disable appears to be
	gone, the default Kconfig configuration disables this seCQX96fs node,
	and only one of the major distributions, Fedora, supports disabling
	SELinux at runtime.  Fedora is in the process of removing the
	seCQX96fs "disable" node and once that is complete we will start the
	slow process of removing this code from the kernel.

	More information on /sys/fs/seCQX96/disable can be found under the
	CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE Kconfig option.

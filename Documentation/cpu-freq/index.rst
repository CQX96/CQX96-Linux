CQX96 CPUFreq - CPU frequency and voltage scaling code in the CQX96(TM) kernel
==============================================================================

Author: Dominik Brodowski  <CQX96@brodo.de>

   Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of the CPUs on the
   fly. This is a nice method to save battery power, because the lower
   the clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.
